        <h2>Relevant Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improving Effectiveness and Equity in Kidney Exchange Programs (2024)</strong><br>
                <p> As a research assistant, I have been involved in designing and implementing survival models for kidney transplants. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dream Team Generator for School Cohesion (2022)</strong><br>
                <p>Led the development of a Dream Team Generator, funded by CORFO, aimed at enhancing cohesion within schools. The project involved creating an algorithm that optimizes team composition by considering a variety of social and academic metrics. This tool has been successfully implemented to foster collaboration and improve the sense of community among students and staff, contributing to a more inclusive and supportive school environment.</p>
            </li>            
            <li><strong>A Novel Machine Learning Pipeline for Variable Star Classification (2018-2022)</strong><br>
                <p> As a research assistant, I developed a machine learning pipeline that classifies variable stars. This pipelines were designed mainly to handle the challenges of data shift in astronomical observations.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Early Warning System for Chilean Tomato Paste Industry (2014-2016)</strong><br>
                <p>As a research assistant, I collaborated on the development of an early warning system to control Alternaria alternata in the Chilean tomato paste industry. This system, funded by FIA, utilized non-destructive technologies to predict and mitigate the impact of agricultural pests, significantly reducing losses in the industry.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Web Optimization Decision Support System for Maule Region Food Processing Plants (2014-2016)</strong><br>
                <p>Directed a project that developed a web-based optimization decision support system for operations planning in food processing plants in the Maule region. Funded by GORE Maule, the system improved operational efficiency and decision-making in the food processing industry.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>On a Class of Robust Combinatorial Optimization Problems (2012-2013)</strong><br>
                <p>Focused on addressing the Min-Max Regret Path Problem, Min-Max Regret Tree Problem, and Interdiction Problems on paths. The research aimed to develop robust solutions that minimize the worst-case regret under uncertainty, with applications in network design and security.</p>
